Tour Guide is a multy-screen app which was written on Android using kotlin language. It presents relevant information
to a user whoâ€™s visiting Bishkek city. The app lists top malls, restaurants, and hotels.

Every location is clickable and opens up the location's description when clicked. Each location contains phone number and address of a location than can be clicked to perform a phone call and map directions.
When the address is clicked, app opens selector window where we can choose in which of our installed apps we want to see the location. (Google Maps, 2GIS, and etc.)

There used Glide library to improve the performance of this app when working with images

The gif of this app is listed below:

In this app I used MVVM architecture with viewBuindings and Glide. Also for changing fragments by scrolling right and left I used tabLayout.
